# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, OpenTrivia API (https://opentdb.com/)

The app is built primairly using React and JavaScript to have some fun playing with different React tools such as useState, useEffect and components. Intially the API call is activated through useEffect and each question was built as a component which had the OpenTrivia object data passed into it. Once the user has made their choices the CSS and the object itself is updated so you can visually see the correct and incorrect answers.

# The Future:
+ I'd like to provide a choice of type of question
+ Save the user game history in local storage

# Lessons Learned:
+ Pushing my React skills
+ Improving CSS techniques
+ Best practices using state and props
